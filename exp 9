# We can do error handling using try and except
try:
    file = open("Jintal.txt")  # I don't have any such file, hence it will throw error.

except Exception as exception:
    print("The exception is ", exception)

# We can write different except block for different types of error.
except IOError as e:
    print("IOError occurred,", e)

# This block will run if any of the except block doesn't runs.
else:
    print("This block will run if except block doesn't runs.")

# finally block contains code that would run whether try or except block runs or not
finally:
    print("This statement will be printed even if try and except block runs or not.")
    
Output :-
The exception is  [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Jintal.txt'
This statement will be printed even if try and except block runs or not.
